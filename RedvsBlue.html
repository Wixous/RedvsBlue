<h2>The Strange Game Experiment!</h2>
<p>
	This is the Strange Game Experiment. In this experiment we have taken the Strange game you have come to know and twisted it into something more.<br>
	We here at Strange Game Inc. have reshaped the game to with new and exciting twists! In this edition of the Strange Game it plays out as follows.<br>
	We began with the familiar 10 by 10 board. Then we took both Red and Blue and placed them in their respective corners. Red is attempting to reach<br>
	Blue's home base, and Blue is attempting to reach Red's home base. Red is still allowed to send Blue back home by landing on them, and Blue is allowed<br>
	to send red home by landing on them. This is where we begin to deviate from the orignal strange game you have come to know and love. We decided<br>
	that it would be interesting to give Red and Blue new ways to move around the board, and so the Strange Game Experiment was born! We have created a<br>
	simulator that allows you to see the results of 4 different variations in the movement patern of Red and Blue. The first Experiment is the control.<br>
	It only allows for basic up,down,left, and right movement from the players. In experiment 2 we have given both players diagonal movement. In experiment 3<br>
	we have given the players up, down, left, right, and diagonal movement. Then in the final experiment we have given Red the ability to move diagonally<br>
	and Blue the ability to move up, down, left, and right. We have set the simulation up to run 5000 games of for each experiment so that you can see<br>
	the statistics more accurately. We here at Strange Game Inc. have found the results to be quite fascinating and hope that you do too.<br>
	<b>Please Note:</b> You can turn on and off each experiment's data to more accurately compare the experiments.<br>
	<h3>**Note** This Experiment can take quite a bit of time due to the number of simulations that are being run please be patient while it is running</h3>
